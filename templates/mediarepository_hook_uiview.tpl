<p>This is nominally hooked up and ready to display. I need to workout how to get access to the informaiton for display, this would be image ide. Ideally
    someone should just be able to references the image id and it should find it.
    They would do this by putting in there text a notify display hooks. The interface would then go through the file, and replace any referneces
    to images with html that will diplay the actual image/document in the correct format.
    I don't know if hooks is the best way to do this, a filter may be better. I will have to discuss this with the parties involved.
